## Challenge

The tattoo industry does not have a lot of technological resources, and not all the studios give a premium service when it comes to communication, personalization, appointment management, referrals...

I wanted to help artists and tattoo shops look professional by automating some parts of their business.

Automation tools can be expensive, and hard to implement. I wanted to create a way to offer these tools in a way that I does not cost me anything.

## Solution

I created my own web app that integrates with third parties.

I planned to offer it as a personalized service instead of SaaS because the onboarding is technical.

I deployed it with free tiers, and the integrated platforms also have free tiers so that anyone can access it for free.

## Key features

- Referral program
- Calendar/Booking automation tools
- Newsletter
- Birthday promos
- Automatic reply
- Appointment reminders
- Submit contract
- Follow-ups after appointment
- Feedback collection

## Results

Although I did not really try to onboard clients or sell this service, it's live for anyone who wants it.

I used the tools listed at the top of the page. It took me 2 weeks to build.

I think this would be a better product if it could be a SaaS and the user did not need personal onboarding. Also if I did my own custom booking and calendar integration, along with a email provider integration. I launched it as an MVP given that those features would be very time consuming for a side project.
