## Challenge

There are lots of very skilled devs out there who won't land a job because they don't have traditional experience.

## Solution

Create a place where the whole point is to judge people by their skill.

## Key features

- Weekly spotlight to showcase projects and developers.
- Use AI to get summaries of the information that recruiters actually want.
- Include side projects and GitHub activity in the user's profile.
- Search by skill-level, tools, relevance...

## Results

I used the tools at the top of the page and I was able to launch pretty fast.

My costs are low because I use free tiers as much as I can and just pay for the database hosting and cdn.

My project is in production and I don't really promote it and try to get users although I really believe in it as a concept.
