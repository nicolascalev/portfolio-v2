## Challenge

Technical people and non-technical people communicate things different, and that's okay. However when people have a problem and they know they can fix it with technology, they know what they want as an outcome but they have no idea what the solution looks like. They may say "I have an idea for an app", while it could be solved with an automation, or a website, or an api...

In the same way, developers can be bad at explaining issues to other people in the organization. Instead of saying "I just keep getting 404" you could say "The resource you are trying to find, could not be found".

Basically, we just need a way to be more aware of the background of another person to know what language to use to communicate effectively.

## Solution

A web application powered by AI.

Inside the context of each organization, you can specify the domain, amount of people, roles, expertise... And based on this information, you can prompt a concept or idea in you own language, and the tool will explain it in a way that a specific member in your organization would understand.

## Key features

- Input organization data and keep it private.
- Use AI to explain concepts or translate
- Keep all your results saved so can come back to them later.
- Bookmark your favorite results.
- Include a paywall because the app has a subscription (per-seat) model.

## Results

I used the tools listed at the top of the page, and I was able to launch in two weeks.

This time I could deploy my frontend and backend to Vercel for free so I don't have to worry about my expenses for this project.

Although this is not my most advanced project, it's one of my cleanest projects and I am very happy with the code.

I want to change something about the UX in the prompt section, I want every chat to exist in the context of just one role. So if the user wants to start another prompt with another role, they would have to start a new chat. I like it this way so that the history of the chat always makes sense when you look back at it.
