        My developer journey started in a Technical Highschool in Costa Rica, where I took 3 years
        of computer science starting on 2017. I learned about the basics of programming. We started
        with LAMP stack. On the second year we learned Node js and the basics of Git and GitHub. On
        my senior year I coded my graduation project with .NET Core (C#) which was a full-stack app
        following the MVC pattern. <br />
        <br />
        In my first job, I worked with a small team that created in-house automation tools for the
        entire organization that lived on the web under a VPN. I developed frontend, APIs and more.
        <br />
        <br />I used those skills I learned, in my next job, where I would do my day to day job and
        also automate some of the repetitive tasks I did daily. That led me to contribute to our
        team in a way that others could use the tools I developed. <br />
        <br />
        On 2022 I got authorized to migrate and work in the US, so I quit my last job at Kyndryl,
        and I have been looking for new opportunities ever since. <br />
        <br />
        To stay updated, and pursue my dreams. I haven&apos;t stopped coding, learning, designing
        and launching new products with the hope of growing my portfolio and landing my first tech
        job in the US. <br />
        <br />I want my next job to take me closer to my professional goals. For me that looks like
        learning more about entrepreneurship, growing a user base, building user experiences that
        convert, and making decisions that build an amazing product. <br />
        <br />I have my favorite set of tools but I have proven to learn fast and adapt and I like
        that challenge. <br />
        <br /> Even if I was rich and had all the options in the world, I am sure I would still be
        coding and building good stuff.
